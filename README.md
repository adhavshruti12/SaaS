# SaaS Solution Setup

## Step-by-Step Approach

#### a. User Registration and Sub-Domain Creation:

1. **User Sign-Up**: Allow clients to sign up on your platform, providing necessary information like name, email, business name, etc.
2. **Sub-Domain Generation**: Upon registration, automatically generate a unique sub-domain for each client based on their business name or a user-defined name.

#### b. Booking Page Template:

1. **Template Design**: Create a customizable booking page template where clients can list their services, availability, and other relevant information.
2. **Customization Options**: Allow clients to customize their booking page with branding elements like logos, colors, and descriptions.

#### c. Backend Integration:

**Database Schema**: Design a database schema to store client information, booking details, and sub-domain mappings.

### 2. Integrating the Payment Gateway

#### a. Choose a Payment Gateway:

1. **Selection**: Choose a payment gateway that fits your needs (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Square).

#### b. Frontend Integration:

1. **Payment Form**: Integrate a payment form into the booking page where users can enter their payment details.
2. **Security Measures**: Ensure the form is secure (e.g., using HTTPS, tokenization, and PCI-DSS compliance).

#### c. User Notification:

1. **Email/SMS Notifications**: Send confirmation emails or SMS messages to clients and their customers upon successful booking and payment.

### Workflow
